## Info
This is an assignment project for Beyond Chats. My name is Aakrisht Srivastava, I have used ReactJS along with tailwind to complete the assignment. To identify the color pallete I use coolors pallet detector.

To run the program locally, use the following commands
```
    npm install
    npm run dev
```

I have tried my best to remake as much of the UI shown in the sample, and have also implemented some of the functionalities.
